# Maintenance

There is no service to operate. Nothing runs between deployments, nothing accumulates,
and there is no on-call. What follows is upkeep of the repository and of the published
site.

## Routine

**Weekly.** Read any failing scheduled run. Nothing is scheduled yet, so this is
currently just the state of `main`.

**Monthly.** Review dependency versions. Every pin is exact, so nothing moves on its own
and nothing is picked up by accident either. Follow
[Maintain dependencies](../how-to/maintain-dependencies.md), and check compatibility
before choosing a version — `@storybook/svelte-vite` pins TypeScript to a 5.x line, so npm
already nests a second compiler beside the 6.x one this repository uses, as
[Decision 0005](../decisions/0005-component-workshop.md) records.

**Monthly.** Run `just check-links-online`. It is not part of the gate because it needs
the network, so external links rot silently until someone looks.

**Per template release.** Take the update on its own, never alongside a behaviour
change: [Update from the template](../how-to/update-from-template.md) says what it
touches and what it leaves alone.

## Deploying

Pushing to `main` deploys, once CI passes on the push. There is no staging environment,
because there is nothing to stage: the artefact is a directory of files, and the only way
it can differ between environments is the base path.

Before pushing anything that changes the build, reproduce it:

```console
BASE_PATH=/<repository name> just frontend-build
BASE_PATH=/<repository name> just preview
```

The base path goes on both commands; see [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md)
for why, and [Deploy to GitHub Pages](../how-to/deploy-to-github-pages.md) for the rest of
the procedure.

## Rolling back

Re-run the last good deployment from the Actions tab, which GitHub allows for 30 days, or
revert and push, which deploys once CI passes on the revert. There is no database to
migrate, no cache to invalidate beyond the browser's, and no in-flight request to drain.

One caveat with real consequences: whatever this game keeps for a player lives in
their browser. A rollback cannot restore data a bad release destroyed, because the
release never had it. Treat any change to how state is stored as one-way, and read
[Architecture](../explanation/architecture.md) before making one.

## Secrets

One is stored: Chromatic's project token, held as a repository secret. Nothing else — no
API keys, no service accounts. The Pages deployment authenticates with a workflow identity
token that GitHub issues per run, so there is nothing to rotate there.

The registry credential is not stored and is not this repository's to rotate: on a laptop
it is the contributor's own `read:packages` token in `~/.npmrc`, and in continuous
integration it is the token GitHub mints for the run. What can be withdrawn is the
package's grant of read access to this repository, which is a setting on the package. If it
ever is, every workflow fails at the install — see
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
