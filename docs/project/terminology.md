# Terminology

These words mean one thing here. Most of them come from the specifications, and using
them loosely is how a review ends up arguing about vocabulary instead of behaviour.

## The game

Two rows to start with; the game adds a row for every term its specification names.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Player | Whoever is at the device. One at a time, and nothing here knows of a second. |
| Play surface | Where Pawlour is played: the platform's cells and keys in an arrangement this game decides. `Play` is its name in the root module. |

## The repository

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Specification | An `.allium` file under `docs/specs/`. Decides behaviour. |
| Surface | A boundary in a specification: what is exposed, what operations are provided, and what is guaranteed. |
| Guarantee | A named prose assertion on a surface. Acceptance criteria, not aspiration. |
| Port | An interface standing in front of a side effect, with a real adapter and an in-memory fake. Three are in `src/lib/ports/`; the device's preferences and its keyboard are the platform package's. |
| Platform | Biscuit Games: the repository that decides everything Pawlour would share with another game. See [The platform upstream](platform.md). |
| Exact | The platform's name for a mark that is wholly right, after the token that paints it. A game whose rules use another word translates it where a mark reaches something rendered. |
| Fake | The in-memory implementation of a port, used by tests. Not a mock: it behaves, rather than recording calls. |
| Gate | A check that can fail the build. Listed in [Quality gates](../reference/quality-gates.md). |
| Recipe | A `Justfile` target. The only supported interface to the checks. |
